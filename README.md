## Herring and Pumpkin Pie

1 butternut squash, depending on the season
20 black olives, pitted
2 cloves garlic
1 medium white onion
¼ teaspoon salt
⅛ teaspoon pepper
Pinch of paprika
2 tablespoons salted butter
1 tablespoon olive oil
⅝ cup cream
4 smoked herring fillets
2 pie crusts, uncooked
1 egg yolk, beaten

1. Scoop the seeds out of the pumpkin, cube the flesh, and steam for approximately 20 minutes.
2. Thinly slice 10 olives, chop the garlic, and slice the onion into rounds.
3. When the pumpkin is soft, remove it from heat and mash it into a purée. Add the salt, pepper, paprika, butter, and olives.
4. Lightly brown the garlic and onion in the oil. Add the cream, and stir to combine. Warm the mixture, and then pour in the pumpkin purée. Stir to combine.
5. Spread the mixture into the bottom of a pie pan ina flat, even layer.
6. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Cut the smoked herring into small pieces, and arrange them on top of the purée, evenly spaced.
7. Cover the contents of the pie with one pie crust. Then cut thin strips from the other pie crust (or from scraps of the first) to lay over the whole crust, as shown in the photo.
8. If desired, you can recreate the fish from the film by cutting out its shape and scales from another piece of pie crust and then placing those pieces on top of the strips.
9. Use a knife tip to poke 10 small cross-shaped holes around the edges of the pie on top of the crust strips. Brush the entire crust with egg yolk. Place the remaining 10 olives in the holes for decoration.
10. Bake the pie for 40 minutes at 350°F.
